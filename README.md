# OOP-phrase-hunter-game
Phrase Hunter is a console game where randomly selected phrases have to be figured out letter by letter. At first instead of letters, only placeholders ('_') will be shown to the player.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the phrase object is updated so that it displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.
